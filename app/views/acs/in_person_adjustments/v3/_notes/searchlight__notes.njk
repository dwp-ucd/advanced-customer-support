<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">v3 Design notes</h3>
	<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
		<li>Since V1 we have increased the number of items on the list under personal details, to reflect the current view more closely in searchlight.</li>
		<li>Updated the wording for the adjustment categories so they are more inclusive, for example “When we speak to them” could be on the phone, in person or video call.</li>
	</ul>
<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Hypotheses</h3>
	<p class="govuk-hint">This is a space for any questions / assumptions we have about this version of the page</p>
	<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
		<li>Adjustments is currently under Personal details, but perhaps it should be above it</li>
		<li>We are asking users what information they would first look for on a customer record. This will inform where the adjustments section sits.</li>
