<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">v3 Design notes</h3>
	<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
		<li>This page did not exist in V1 and V2 because all the adjustments fell under one category. This page has been added in V3 because the change link directs you to the page where you can select spoken adjustments.</li>
		<li>Reverted back to text plus 'Continue' format, rather than Yes / No radio buttons. Discussed this in sprint review and agreed we don't want this question to stop users continuing with journey, as there may be valid reasons why they haven't told the customer what they're doing.</li>
